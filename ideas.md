## Design Approach: Modern Fintech Minimalism with Precision Accents

**Design Movement:** Contemporary fintech design with influences from high-end financial technology (similar to Stripe, Figma, or Anthropic)

**Core Principles:**
1. **Precision & Clarity**: Clean typography, generous whitespace, and intentional visual hierarchy that communicates trust and sophistication
2. **Forward-Looking Aesthetic**: Modern, tech-forward design that signals innovation without being trendy or dated
3. **Data-Driven Elegance**: Subtle use of charts, gradients, and geometric elements that evoke prediction markets and financial data
4. **Accessibility First**: High contrast, readable fonts, and intuitive navigation that welcomes all users

**Color Philosophy:**
- **Primary**: Deep navy blue (`#0F1729`) as the foundation—conveys trust, stability, and professionalism
- **Accent**: Vibrant amber/gold (`#FFB81C`) as the highlight—represents opportunity, value, and the "Aurum" (gold) brand identity
- **Secondary**: Soft slate gray (`#6B7280`) for supporting text and borders—maintains visual hierarchy without distraction
- **Background**: Off-white (`#FAFBFC`) with subtle gradients—provides breathing room and reduces eye strain
- **Accent Highlights**: Emerald green (`#10B981`) for positive indicators (growth, opportunity)

**Layout Paradigm:**
- Asymmetric hero section with diagonal visual dividers and layered content
- Alternating left-right content blocks for product showcase and features
- Generous vertical spacing (6-8rem sections) to create visual rhythm
- Sticky navigation with glassmorphic effect (semi-transparent backdrop blur)
- Grid-based feature cards with hover depth effects

**Signature Elements:**
1. **Geometric Accents**: Subtle diagonal lines, hexagons, and chart-like patterns that reference prediction markets
2. **Gradient Overlays**: Soft gradients from navy to transparent, creating depth without overwhelming the content
3. **Animated Charts**: Subtle animated line charts or candlestick patterns in the background of key sections

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth scroll-triggered animations (fade-in, slide-up) for content sections
- Hover effects on cards: subtle lift (shadow increase), color shift to accent color
- Button interactions: color transition, slight scale, and shadow depth on hover/active states
- Micro-interactions: icon animations, loading states with animated spinners

**Animation Guidelines:**
- Use `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` for smooth, professional motion
- Scroll-triggered animations: fade-in from opacity 0 to 1 over 600ms
- Staggered animations on card lists: each card enters 100ms after the previous
- Hero section: subtle parallax effect on background elements (10-15% offset on scroll)
- Button hover: 200ms color transition + 100ms scale (1.02x)

**Typography System:**
- **Display Font**: "Poppins" (600-700 weight) for headlines—modern, geometric, and distinctive
- **Body Font**: "Inter" (400-500 weight) for body text—highly readable and professional
- **Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Hero): 48px Poppins 700, line-height 1.2
  - H2 (Section): 36px Poppins 600, line-height 1.3
  - H3 (Subsection): 24px Poppins 600, line-height 1.4
  - Body: 16px Inter 400, line-height 1.6
  - Small Text: 14px Inter 400, line-height 1.5
